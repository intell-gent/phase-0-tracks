# Notes

* what worked?
    - I started out learning with Try jqury that was powered by codeschool.
    - overall it went well but i felt it was a little time inefficient.
    - once i started testing it out on my own project i learned a lot more.
    - also learning by dealing with the errors and researching proved to be much more effective.
* what did not work?
    - I ran into a lot of issue with getting my project started using jquery.
    - THis was mostly due to the tutorial not showing you how to implement jquery in a new html document.
    - it was also difficult thinking of ways to use jquery in interesting ways but i eventual y figured it out.
