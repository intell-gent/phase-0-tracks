# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - is the ability to track and control the version of your code and can be rolled back if a new version breaks the code
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - a branch is like a copy of the master but allows you to edit it without effecting the original.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - a commit is saving the changes made to your code like an update/add/bugfix. good commit messages give i good discription of what changes were made so if a break happens a developer can have a better idea what might be the cause.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - a merge conflict is when you have two people working on the same file with diffrent versions one older one newer.
